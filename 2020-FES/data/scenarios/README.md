# NorthernPowerGrid Scenarios

This directory contains configuration for the visualisation as well as data files to power it.

## Adding a new parameter

Let's add a new parameter. 

### Add CSV files

Add the CSV files for this parameter to the [Primaries data directory](https://github.com/odileeds/northern-powergrid/tree/master/data/scenarios/gridsupplypoints).

### Update the index

We need to let the visualisation know that the CSV files exist and where they are. Edit the [index.json](https://github.com/odileeds/northern-powergrid/blob/master/data/scenarios/index.json) file. We need a _unique_ key for the new parameter. Existing keys are e.g. `ev`, `peakdemand`, `peakutilisation` etc. Keys should be simple - they won't be displayed in the visualisation - and any special characters (e.g. `‘`, `”`, `\`) will need to be escaped with a `\`. For this example we will use `newparameter`. Add the new parameter to each of the scenarios e.g.

```javascript
{
  "Community renewables": {
    "description": "<ul><li>Achieves 80% decarbonisation by 2050.</li><li>Local energy schemes flourish.</li></ul>",
    "color": "#E6007C",
    "css": "c9-bg",
    "data": {
      "ev": {
        "primary": { "file": "gridsupplypoints/EV-CommunityRenewables.csv" }
      },
      "newparameter": {
        "primary": { "file": "gridsupplypoints/NewParameter-CommunityRenewables.csv" }
      },
      ...
    }
  }
  ...
}
```
Once you've finished adding this parameter to `index.json`, check it is valid JSON using [JSON Lint](https://jsonlint.com/) otherwise you could break the visualisation if you have an invalid file.

### Update configuration

Next we need to update the [config.json](config.json) file. This file contains the configuration for each of the parameters that appear in the drop-down box in the visualisation. It uses the same keys as in the `index.json` file (e.g. `ev` and `heatpumps`) to list the configuration of each parameter. The order of the keys in this file determines the order of the options in the drop-down. The format of each parameter is a JSON object (key-value pairs) along the lines of:

```javascript
"newparameter": { "title": "Our brand new parameter", "combine": "sum", "units":"", "dp": 0, "description": "The short description that appears below the drop down" }
```

Where:
* `key` is a _unique_ key for this property;
* `title` is the label that appears in the drop down list (e.g. `Electric Vehicles (number)`);
* `combine` determines how Primary Sub-station values are combined into Local Authorities (`sum` to add each Primary contribution up or `max` to find the maximum value of a Primary in the Local Authority);
* `units` is the label to put after a number on the scale and popups (e.g. `MWh`);
* `description` is the help text that appears below the drop down.

Check that your changes are still valid JSON using [JSON Lint](https://jsonlint.com/).

## Adding or changing scenarios

The scenarios are defined in [index.json](index.json). There can be as many scenarios as we want as long as they each have different names and the associated parameter files to go with them. Each scenario is defined as follows:

```
	"Scenario 1": {
		"description": "<p>Here's a list:</p><ul><li>Bullet point 1</li><li>Bullet point 2</li></ul>",
		"color": "#E6007C",
		"css": "c9-bg",
		"data": {
			"ev": {
				"primary": { "file": "gridsupplypoints/EV-S1.csv" }
			},
			"peakdemand":{
				"primary": { "file": "gridsupplypoints/PeakDemand-S1.csv" }
			},
			"peakutilisation":{
				"primary": { "file": "gridsupplypoints/PeakUtilisation-S1.csv" }
			},
			"windcapacity":{
				"primary": { "file": "gridsupplypoints/WindCapacity-S1.csv" }
			}
		}
	},
```

where `Scenario 1` defines a unique key (and title) for this scenario. Each scenario then has the following sub-properties:

* `description` - some HTML that gets shown below the scenario drop-down box in the visualisation;
* `color` - the hex code of the colour to use for this scenario;
* `css` - the CSS class to use for this scenario (defined in [style.css](../resources/style.css));
* `data` - an object containing links to the data files for each parameter. The unique keys used for the parameters must match those used in [config.json](config.json). For each parameter we explicitly include `primary` as a property - this lets humans know how the data are organised and allows us to have multiple data sources in future if we need.
