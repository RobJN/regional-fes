,,Dem_BB003,Demand,GWh,Total Annual consumption in GWh,"Total demand consumption at GSP level, including losses, any energy saving and new LCT driven demand growth",,,,Y,"The Building block data has been developed using a combination of modelling approaches for generating geographical split of demand. This year we’ve introduced a bottom-up approach for modelling demand for heat in buildings, where calculations are performed from data below the GSP and then aggregated up to GSP level. Transport demand modelling on the other hand starts with a GB level estimate of demand which we then disaggregate down to GSP level. There are some trade-offs with this mixed approach to generating GSP level data and some combinations of the individual elements will need refining in the future.  As always, we’ll continue to work with stakeholders to improve our assumptions and modelling methodologies."
